# NYC-Trip-Planner
This repository contains the code for the project "NYC Trip Planner ". The project aims to build an interactive route-planning system using Google Places API and Geolocations API. The routes are planned with multiple Dynamic Programming and Greedy algorithms. 

The system will allow users to choose attractions they want to visit in New York City, the starting and ending points of their trip, and the maximum time they would like to spend traveling daily. 

The system will plan an efficient trip plan for travelers, with a reasonable time complexity. The efficient trip plan will offer 1. As few days as possible and 2. As little distance between different points as possible.
